AngularJS with ASP.NET WebAPI toy project

I wanted to work through a simple AngularJS/WebAPI project to shake the dust off of my brain with regard to those technologies.  Luckily, PluralSight has just surfaced a new course that does this nicely.

My original intention was to do this using VSCode on the Mac, but given that VSCode's support for templating is pretty limited, I decided to go with VS2013 Express on a Windows10 build instead.  The next project will be a straight-up C# implementation on the Mac using VSCode, I promise!  :-)
